[#examples]
== Examples

RacksDB provides several fully working examples of databases. When RacksDB is
installed, these examples are available in `/usr/share/doc/rackslab/examples`.

It is recommended to use these examples as a starting point to define your own
database.

Run this command to copy a complete example:

[source,console]
----
$ cp -r /usr/share/doc/racksdb/examples/db/* /var/lib/racksdb/
----

Then adapt the content of the files to match your actual infrastructures.
