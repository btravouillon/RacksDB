= Database Files

== Location

By default, RacksDB expects the database to be located in
[.path]#`/var/lib/racksdb`# directory, splitted into multiple files.

NOTE: RacksDB can load databases at the location of your choice, at the
condition of specifying the path in xref:usage:racksdb.adoc[`racksdb`
command] options and xref:usage:api.adoc[library `load()`] arguments. For this
reason, it is highly recommended to use the default path.

== Files Tree

RacksDB database can be stored in a single YAML file. However, for obvious
maintenaibility reasons, it is recommended to split the database into multiple
files. RacksDB can load a database by walking into a directory recursively. It
loads all YAML formatted files with `.yml` extension. It perfoms a mapping
between the files hierarchy and the resulting YAML tree.

When a folder is suffixed by `.l`, RacksDB considers the files in this folder
to be members of a sequence (_aka._ list or array). The content of each of these
files is an item in this list. In this case, the filename is ignored.

In other folders, the files are considered to be a key/value pair of a mapping
(_aka_. hash or associative array). The filename without its extension is the
key, the value is the content of the file.

Following these principles, users are free to choose the level of fragmentation
in the database model, at their own convenience.

For example, consider this basic example YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
apples:
- variety: granny smith
  color: green
- variety: golden
  color: yellow
stocks:
  apples:
    granny smith: 10
    golden: 20
----

It is strictly identical to this folder tree:

[source]
----
ðŸ“‚ apples.l/
  ðŸ“„ granny.yml
  ðŸ“„ golden.yml
ðŸ“‚ stocks/
  ðŸ“„ apples.yml
----

With the following files content:

`granny.yml`::

[source,yaml]
----
variety: granny smith
color: green
----

`golden.yml`::

[source,yaml]
----
variety: golden
color: yellow
----

`apples.yml`::

[source,yaml]
----
granny smith: 10
golden: 20
